Project Summary
Problem Statement
The project aimed to develop an embedded system for IoT (Internet of Things) applications using the CC3220 microcontroller from Texas Instruments. The primary goal was to create a system that could monitor temperature, control an LED (used as a heater), and report data to an external server via UART communication. The project addressed the challenge of real-time data monitoring and cloud connectivity, particularly in IoT scenarios.

Achievements
What I Did Well
Effective Task Scheduling: To meet the project's real-time requirements, I implemented a task scheduler. It allowed the system to check buttons, monitor temperature, and communicate with the server in a time-efficient manner.

GPIO and Timer Configuration: I successfully configured GPIO pins for button input, LED output, and timer functionality. This ensured precise control over system components.

Cloud Connectivity: Setting up cloud connectivity through UART communication was executed well. The system effectively sent data to an external server, which was a key project requirement.

Areas for Improvement
Error Handling: While the system performed well under normal conditions, I could improve error-handling mechanisms for unexpected situations. Robust error handling would enhance system reliability.

Code Modularity: Although the code was organized, I see potential for further code modularization, making it more readable and maintainable. Breaking down complex functions into smaller, reusable modules would be beneficial.

Tools and Resources
Expanding My Support Network
For future projects and courses, I plan to expand my support network by:

Online Communities: Engaging more actively in online forums and communities related to embedded systems and IoT to seek advice, share experiences, and learn from others.

Mentorship: Seeking mentorship from experienced professionals in embedded systems and IoT to gain insights into best practices and industry trends.

Advanced Courses: Enrolling in advanced courses and workshops related to microcontroller programming, cloud connectivity, and real-time systems.

Transferable Skills
Skills for Future Projects
From this project, I've developed several skills that are highly transferable to other projects and course work:

Task Scheduling: The experience of implementing a task scheduler is a valuable skill that can be applied to various real-time systems.

Peripheral Configuration: I gained expertise in configuring GPIO pins, timers, and UART communication, which are fundamental skills in embedded systems development.

Error Handling: Learning from the project's challenges, I can apply improved error-handling techniques to ensure robustness in future projects.

Maintainability and Readability
Making the Project Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable
To ensure the project's maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I followed these practices:

Modular Code: I organized the code into reusable modules, making it easier to understand and adapt for future changes.

Comments and Documentation: I provided clear comments for functions and critical code sections, enhancing code readability.

Version Control: The project was managed using version control systems (e.g., Git), allowing for easy tracking of changes and collaboration.

Testing and Validation: I rigorously tested the system to ensure its functionality, and I documented test cases and results for reference.

Naming Conventions: I used consistent and meaningful variable and function names, improving code readability.

Overall, the project was structured and documented with an emphasis on maintainability and adaptability, enabling easier collaboration and future enhancements.
